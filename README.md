Programme in PHP plain (vanila) to calculate power, energy, and the total charge based on the current rate.

The electricity consumption charge is easy to understand and calculate. It is measured in kWh (kilowatt-hours). The rate of an electricity bill varies. Suppose we have the following conditions for calculating the rates of electricity:
Power (Wh) = Voltage (V) * Current Â (A)
Energy (kWh) = Power * Hour * 1000 ;
Total = Energy(kWh) * (current rate/100);
